"""Reproduction block generation (FR-030).

Derives runnable-shaped reproduction steps from a finding's own evidence and its
traced flow. Safety constraints (the "benign-proof standard"):

* triggers use non-destructive **canary** values that demonstrate the flaw
  without causing damage — never destructive payloads;
* no real credentials or secrets appear (the redactor is applied as a backstop);
* steps explicitly target a local/test deployment.
