"""Pre-write report consistency gate (FR-040–FR-042).

A **gate**, not a warning. The whole point is that a self-inconsistent report never
reaches a reader — the reviewed benchmark told its reader to see a Medium finding
"in the High section" of a report with no High section, and printed a reproduction
step whose precondition its own impact paragraph denied. Both are the kind of
defect that costs a report its credibility even when every technical claim in it
is sound.
