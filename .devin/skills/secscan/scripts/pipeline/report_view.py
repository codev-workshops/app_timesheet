"""Derived report views (FR-018).

The unified workspace report is the single source of truth; per-repository views
are *projections* of it, never separate scans. This module re-renders a stored
report, optionally filtered to one repository, so subsystem teams can see only
what is theirs while cross-system findings remain visible to whichever repos they
implicate.
